## The Mystery Rock of Mars
Using satellite images, NASA scientists spotted something strange on Mars. 
A powerful windstorm had blown away the red dust, uncovering a mysterious rock.

It wasn’t just any rock.

It didn't look like any other rock on Mars. It sparkled in a way no other 
Martian rock ever had — almost as if it were alive.

Early tests suggested the rock might hold incredible secrets:
  - Clues that life once existed on Mars.
  - Or even special properties that could help heal sick humans back on Earth.

But NASA has not been able to bring it home to study.
The rock sits in a spot where rockets cannot safely land.

So they made a plan:

“One day, a team of brilliant young engineers will send a robot rover to fetch this rock and deliver it to our Mars Base.”

That team is YOU.
